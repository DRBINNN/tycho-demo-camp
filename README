Sonar analysis
--------------
You can run mvn clean install -PcodeCoverage and then mvn sonar:sonar -PcodeCoverage from the parent project.
And check the sonar analysis here: http://ec2-79-125-43-108.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/sonar/

You can edit/remove the sonar connection settings in order to use your own Sonar instance.
